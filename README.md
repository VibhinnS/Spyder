As per the research paper, [**Electrical-Thermal Co-Simulation of 3D Integrated Systems With Micro-Fluidic Cooling and Joule Heating Effects**](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=86fce3a79b5d40ff6635092b7ba5f13576999031), we have written our own electro thermal solver and paired it with the CMA-Es algorithm to optimise the thermal profile and electrical performance of 3-D ICs. 

We are in phase to add the CMA - ES algorithm and pair it with the solver to optimise 3-D IC manufacturing based on 5 paramaters. 


UPDATE - We're switching to using electro thermal solver from Cadence Virtuosa or Altium Pro. For the CMA algorithm, it feels best to use third party library as of now. Will be writing the solver code later if needed.
